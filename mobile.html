		<div>Frank Norman

Safety is a priority in everything we do here at SGN and Frank, the winner of the Safety First award, personifies this. He was nominated by General Manager Graham Cox who said: “Frank’s local knowledge and quick thinking helped contractors avoid what could have been a serious incident while he was out working earlier this year. It was a great example of ‘not walking by’.” Frank was driving past some contractors who were conducting a directional drilling operation. Frank knew there was a high pressure main near the spot they were about to drill. He instructed the contractors to stop work and reported the incident to the Engineering Manager and the Plant Protection Officer. The site was then visited by both who worked with the contractors to establish minimum separation zones and agree safe systems of work.</div>

Working with the Royal Voluntary Service

Through our partnership with RVS we aim to also make more people aware of:

• The Priority Service Register where
   pensioners and other vulnerable people
   can get extra help and support with
   their energy supply.

• Discounted gas connections

• Carbon monoxide

• Our locking valve which allows cookers
   to be turned off and on by carers and
   family members looking after vulnerable
   people.
  
We’ve now reached a significant milestone of connecting our 10,000th customer in Scotland through our Help to Heat scheme, which supports low income and vulnerable households.</div>

Women in Engineering













realised this career path was within my reach and was something I’d enjoy. I’ve been to college, as well as doing an IT and telecoms apprenticeship before joining SGN.”

It has not been completely straightforward for Sara but having supportive colleagues has really helped her development. She added: “I’m currently responsible for a few small projects which bring their own challenges. After initially struggling with self-confidence in my new environment, my colleagues, both male and female, have been very supportive and have made me feel comfortable in my role. It’s definitely worth stepping out of your comfort zone to consider a career in engineering.”</div>
		<div>At SGN we don’t just offer a job for life, we offer a career.

Four years ago, Tussie Patel came to work at SGN through an agency as a temporary finance assistant before moving on to become Business Performance Manager (BPM) for our South Downs replacement depot. Today, she’s back in our Finance team working as Finance Business Partner to our BPMs. Tussie is an advocate for taking your development into your own hands. Here’s her top tips:

Speak up. Let your manager know about your ambitions. Ask for development opportunities. The Training and Development team are fantastic at supporting employees with their training programmes.

Work hard. Set realistic but challenging goals. Take a step outside your comfort zone and ask questions… lots of them! Get over any fears that a question might sound silly.

Get yourself out there! Raise your profile by visiting other depots when the opportunity comes up. Or why not volunteer as a comms champ or social coordinator? You could submit an Ignite idea, or even write a blog to let others know what you do.</div>

She thinks that encouraging young girls to think about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers as early as possible would help. She said: “I think getting into schools would be very effective in encouraging girls from a young age. Our partnerships with Girlguiding and Solutions for the Planet are very valuable. It’s about making the industry less ‘scary’ and making girls aware of the roles that are there for them – it’s not just about digging holes.”

After originally being interested in a career in Forensic Pathology as a girl, her confidence took a knock due to the attitudes of others. She added: “I was laughed at, which did impact my confidence initially. But I got over that, and there are more opportunities for young women today than ever before. Age or gender should never be a barrier."</div>

Chris Holford, Deputy Team Manager, began his career as a Poole depot GN01 before being promoted to Replacement Team Leader. Having recently completed the Aspiring Team Manager Programme, Chris is now a Repair Manager at Poole depot. Chris said: “The programme is great as it is structured to the individual’s specific needs. The programme has given me a great insight to the make-up and history of gas as a whole, and where it comes from. It has developed my understanding of the how SGN adheres to regulations, legislation, processes of safety to ensure the wellbeing of our staff, which is imperative when being a team manager.”</div>
